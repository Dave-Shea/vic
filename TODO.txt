- Needs an installer completed install(1) via sh(1) will do nicely.

- (re)write instance launch tooling

- Rationalize DNS in self-contained manner, (none of the lambda hyjinks)

# nice to have
- Consider removing underscores/dashes from the canonical VIC name.

- Handle the bootstrap, considering instance launch tooling consistency
