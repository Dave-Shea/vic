# specific needs,
- Needs an installer completed install(1) via sh(1) will do nicely.

- (re)write instance launch tooling

- Rationalize DNS in self-contained manner, (none of the lambda hyjinks)

- INIT: Rationalize optional public domain name (e.g. vic-name.publicname.tld)
    - apply to gateway hosts
    - apply to any other ingress/egress

# nice to have
- Consider removing underscores/dashes from the canonical VIC name.

- Handle the bootstrap, considering instance launch tooling consistency



# Just bugs
