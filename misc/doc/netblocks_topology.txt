# This file descirbes various levels netblock organization,
# covering all major components of a VIC, organized hierarchically.
#
# While many AWS specific terms may be used, the topology conforms to any
# infrastructure foundation, including bare metal and alternative public
# cloud providers.  Without special consideration, the design and
# reservations should stay infrastructure agnostic.
#
# What follows aims to be a trivially parsable description of each element of
# VIC structure, using example netblocks and names.  This serves to provide
# diagram generation etc..., but can be trivially condensed, for example,
#  $ grep -v '^#' netblocks_topology.txt | grep .
#
# Throughout, several examples refer to a browser based subnet calculator,
# which is provided in this repo, vic:/misc/net/cidr_calc/subnets.html
# Simply opening this file in a web browser allows you to use this tool,
# and view the examples listed.

# Current implementation incorporates 4 VPC subnets:
#   1) "WAN" (aka DMZ) Subnet, containing the IGW for a given VIC.
#   2) "base" Subnet, containing vic-base instances and services.
#   3) "Core" Subnet, hosts and services subnet. 
#   4) "Data" Subnet, data layer services and hosts.
#
# These 4 VPC subnets are described in more detail in the sections below.

# Top Level Domain
# Internal TLD for all VICs, there is only one.
# These are explicitly *not* internet TLD's, but are instead only internal
# domains.  From inside of any VIC, (actual, or VPN endpoint connection),
# this Route53 TLD can be queried for DNS records in the entire .vic
# universe.  Measures are taken to ensure DNS record writes for a given
# VIC, can only be made from inside a given VIC domain.
tld=vic

# Internal domain name for a VIC
# Predetermined names which conform to the rules set in rfc3490 for label
#  parts of domain names, (the parts between dots).  Since this is
# unicode, underscores are allowed.  Additional rules are as follows:
#  - each VIC name must be unique for an org
#  - name batches must be pre-generated to avoid ad-hock nomenclature problems
#  - each VIC name must be <=32 unicode characters
# Pre-generated names are to be used, see vic_512_names.txt in this repo.
# DNS/Route53 'writes' for a given domain can only happen from
# inside that domain.  Yet, domains for all org VIC's can be
# queried from inside *any* VIC network.
domain=hot_latte

# Every named host and network endpoint can now bear this name,
vic_fqdn="${domain}.${tld}"

# AWS Region
# There can only be one, VPC's can only exist in one AWS Region,
# analogous to a POP.

# AWS Availability Zones
# Predetermined list of availability zones, colon separated.

# VPC Netblock, aka 'superblock', aka 'network'
# Predetermined netblocks from the 10/8 RFC1918 specification.
# 192.168/16 and 172.16/12 prefixed networks belong to IT for
# offices and other uses.
# Correlates to entire domain name for a VIC.

# SUBNETS

# "WAN" Subnet, aka "Gateway netblock", aka "DMZ netblock" 
# Required for internet inbound egress.
# A /22 subnet from the domain_netblock, 1023 available IP's.
# Only one VPC subnet can be configured with access to Elastic IP's, or
# Internet-facing ELB's.  Edge devices can pick up network interfaces
# in this network, including internet-routable EIP's.
# Always the first /22 from the network /17, therefore the last
# two octets are always start with 0.0 for this /17'
# This network may never contain any hosts, yet, bastion hosts or other
# internet-only hosts may be small exceptions here.
wan_netblock="10.254.0.0/22"

# "base" Subnet
# A /21 subnet from the domain_netblock, 1023 available IP's.
# Contains all "core" infrastructure services, which must be provisioned
# during the VIC bootstrap, and are typically accessible to all networks
# except any which may originate from hosts solely in the gateway network.
# Services which may be included here are:
#  - provisioning (cfengine)
#  - syslog relay(s)
#  - smtp relay(s)
#  - core cron services
#  - ntpd relay (or AWS internal endpoint)
#  - centralized file services (or AWS internal endpoint)
#  - VPC endpoints for various services,
#    - Org-global VIC S3 buckets
#    - RDS Instances
core_svcs_netblock="10.254.0.0/22"

# "Core" Subnet, hosts and services subnet. 
# *All* application hosts.
# The list is too large for this document, but every host currently
# deployed via CFEngine is to be launched here.

# "Data" Subnet, data layer services and hosts.
# The data layer, we may as well split it off clean now.
# This layer contains all data services, including:
#  - RDS Database Endpoints
#  - S3 Bucket Endpoint for Applications
#  - Any Instances which contain Persistent Data
