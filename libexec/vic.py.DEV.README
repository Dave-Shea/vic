For development simplicity, this libexec directory should contain a symbolic
link to our vic.py library, e.g.

  ./vic.py -> ../lib/python/vic.py 

This symbolic link should not be included in the final installation, as the
vic library will simply be installed in our pythonpath, (or, the pythonpath
on local installation will be appended with our library dir.)

This symlink allows us to simply 'import vic' in our applications, with no
gotchas or edge cases to worry about.
